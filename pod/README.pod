The SWISH-E README File

=head1 What is SWISH-E?

SWISH-E is B<S>imple B<W>eb B<I>ndexing B<S>ystem for B<H>umans - B<E>nhanced.
SWISH-E can quickly and easily index directories of files or remote web sites and search the generated
indexes.

SWISH was created by Kevin Hughes to fill the need of the growing number of Web administrators on the
Internet - many of the indexing systems were not well documented, were hard to use and install,
and were too complex for their own good. The system was widely used for several years,
long enough to collect some bug fixes and requests for enhancements.

In Fall 1996, The Library of UC Berkeley received permission from Kevin Hughes to implement bug fixes and
enhancements to the original binary. The result is SWISH-Enhanced or SWISH-E, brought to you by the
SWISH-E Development Team.

SWISH-E version 2.2 represents a major rewrite of the code and the addition of many new features.
Memory requirements for indexing have been reduced, and indexing speed is much improved.
New features allow more control over indexing, better document parsing, improved indexing and searching
logic, better filter code, and the ability to index from any data source.

database management system (RDBMS).

=item *

Document "properties" (some subset of the source document, usually
defined as a META or XML elements) may be stored in the index and
returned with search results

=item *

Document summaries can be returned with each search

=item *

=head1 Where do I get SWISH-E?

The current version of SWISH-E can be found at:

http://swish-e.org

Please make sure you use a current version of swish-e.

Information about Windows binary distributions can also be
found at this site.

=head1 How Do I Install Swish?

Read the L<INSTALL|INSTALL> page.  Information on specific ports
(VMS and Win32) can be found in sub-directories of the C<src> directory.

The Windows binary can be found in the C<src/win32> directory.

In addition to the INSTALL page,
make sure you read the L<SWISH-FAQ|SWISH-FAQ> page if you have any questions, or
to get an idea of questions that you might someday ask.


=head1 The SWISH-E Documentation

Documetation is provided in the SWISH-E distribution package in two forms, POD (Plain Old Documentation),
and in html format.  The POD documentation is in the F<pod> directory, and the HTML documentation is in the
F<html> directory, of course.

If your system includes the required support files and programs,
the distribution make files can also generate the documentation in these formats:

    Postscript
    PDF (Adobe Acrobat)
    system man pages

You may also build a "split" version of the documentation where each topic heading is a separate
web page.  Building the split version also creates a SWISH-E index of the documentation that makes
the documentation searchable via the included Perl CGI program.

Buiding these other forms of documentation require aditional helper applications -- most modern Linux
distributions will include all that's needed.  At least mine does...  You shouldn't have a problem
if you have kept your perl and perl libraries up to date.

Online documentation can be found at the SWISH-E web site listed above.

See L<INSTALL|INSTALL> for information on creating the PDF and Postscript
versions of the documentation, and for information on installing the SWISH-* documentation as Unix man(1) pages.


=head2 How do I read the SWISH-E documentation?

The SWISH-E documentation included with the SWISH-E distribution is in POD and HTML formats.
The POD documentation can be found in the F<pod> directory, and the HTML documentation can be
found in the F<html> directory.

To view the HTML documentation point your browser to the F<html/index.html> file.

The POD documentation is displayed by
the "perldoc" command that is included with every Perl installation.
For example, to view the swish-e installation documentation page called "INSTALL", type

   perldoc pod/INSTALL

or to make life easier,

   cd pod
   perldoc INSTALL
   perldoc SWISH-RUN

Complain to your system administrator if the C<perldoc> command is not available on your machine.

=head2 Document Generation

The SWISH-E documentation in HTML format was created with Pod::HtmlPsPdf, a package of Perl modules written
and/or modified by Stas Bekman to automate the conversion of documents in pod format (see perldoc perlpod)
to HTML, Postscript, and PDF.  A slightly modified version of this package is include with the SWISH-E distribution
and used for building the HTML.  As distributed, SWISH-E contains only the pod and HTML documentation.
See L<INSTALL|INSTALL> for instructions on creating man(1), Postscript, and PFD formats.

Thanks, Stas, for your help!
