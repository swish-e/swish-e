These are example scripts that can be used with SWISH-E.

swish.cgi   - example search script that allows displaying results
              page-by-page.  Type `perldoc swish.cgi' from the
              examples directory for instructions.

swish2.cgi -  example script that uses modules such as HTML::Template
              to separate content from program logic, and uses modules
              as to abstract the interface to swish.
              Can easily be adjusted to limit searches by metanames
              and also sort and display additional properties defined
              in your index.
              Will run under mod_perl.
              The CGI script does require Perl modules available
              on CPAN.
              Type `perldoc swish2.cgi' from the
              examples directory for instructions.              

swish.gif   - Swish-e logo for the CGI scripts.              

swish.tmpl  - HTML template files for use with swish.cgi.
swish2.tmpl   These are just simple examples that you can modify
              to meet your needs.  They are use with the swish2.cgi
              example program.

SWISH-Stemmer-0.05.tar.gz
