<h3>The Players</h3>

<p>
You can't tell the players without a program. And we wouldn't have a program without
all these players! All these folks have made key contributions to Swish-e:

<h4><i>On the Field</i></h4>

<DL>

<DT><b>Bill Moseley</b><DT>
<dd>
The person leading the charge.  Rewrote much of the documentation and bundled it with the distribution
(you now know who to complain to), added the "prog" document source feature,
added Expat and libxml2 parsers, redesigned properties, and added many new and exciting features.
</dd>

<dt><b>Jose Manuel Ruiz</b></dt>

<dd>
Jose added phrase searching and has made huge contributions toward speed and memory
usage improvements.  He added result sorting, improved metanames and properties, merging, and searching.
Swish is the powerful program it is today because of Jose.  And there's more coming!
</dd>

<dt><B>David Norris</B></dt>

<dd>
David has provided ports to all flavors of Windows, as well as a Swish-e interface script written in PHP3.
The windows version is now bundled with a self installer, making instalation just a click away.
</dd>


<dt><b>Peter Karman</b></dt>
<dd>Peter added improvements to the ranking code and a new website design. His main role is creating more
work for Bill.</dd>

<dt><b>Roy Tennant</b></dt>

<dd>Roy was the one who originally rescued SWISH when Kevin Hughes, the
original author, was no longer supporting it. He has remained active in
the effort since the beginning, but can't code in C to save his life,
and therefore must remain content with web site support and other such
minor tasks.</dd>

</dl>

<H4><i>Hall of Fame</i></H4>


<dl>


<dt><b>Bill Meier</b></dt>
<dd>
Bill improved the ranking code, and provided much help in memory optimizations and indexing speed.
</dd>

<dt><B>Rainer Scherg</B></dt>
<dd>
Rainer has worked on Swish-e for many years.  Rainer added Swish-e's filters providing ways to index many
document types.  Rainer also added the powerful "-x" feature to easily control Swish-e's output.
<dd>


<dt><b>Giulia Hill</b></dt>

<dd>Giulia was the first programmer to tackle upgrading SWISH to
Swish-e, back when it was a project of the UC Berkeley Library.
Without her, we would not have gotten out of the starting gate.</dd>

<dt><b>Ron Klatchko</b></dt> <dd>Ron added the crawling capability to
Swish-e, subsequently enhanced by others.</dd>

<dt><b>Kirk Hastings</b></dt>

<dd>Kirk programmed a neat Perl-based tool, called "AutoSwish" that
allowed anyone to easily set up and maintain indexes from a web page.
Unfortunately, this program is no longer a part of the release due to
security issues.</dd>

<dt><b>Bas Meijer</b></dt>

<dd>
Bas has been an active member of the Swish-e team since 1999 providing code enhancements and user support.  
He converted Swish-e's build process to the GNU Auto Configure script and ported Swish-e to a number of
platforms.  Bas has also provided add-on scripts to the Swish-e user community.
</dd>


<dt><B>Marc Gaulin</B></dt>
<dd>
Marc added code to support the document properties and stemming features, among other things.

<dd>
The source of a number of
SWISH bug fixes that were implemented in the first Swish-e release
</dd>

</p>

<P>
We owe a debt of gratitude to <a href="http://kevcom.com/"><B>Kevin 
Hughes</B></a>, without whom there would be no SWISH, and definitely no 
Swish-e. His dedication to building useful tools and making them widely 
available should be an inspiration to us all.
