<p>Swish-e is a community effort.
Swish-e is developed and supported completely through the efforts of volunteers.
After reading the [% link_to_page( 'swish-faq', 'Swish-e FAQ' ) %], 
the [% link_to_page( 'docs', 'Swish-e documentation' ) %], and using
the Search tool at the top of the page (which searches all documentation
and the discussion archives),
ponder the immortal words of Blanche Dubois in Tennessee William's
<i>A Streetcar Named Desire</i>:
"I have often relied upon the kindness of strangers."
